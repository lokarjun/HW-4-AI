# Makefile for ChaCha20 Batch Test Simulation
#
# Description:
# This Makefile configures and runs the cocotb batch-mode testbench 
# for the ChaCha20 hardware accelerator project. It uses pre-generated 
# input files (JSON manifest) to drive multi-block encryption workloads 
# through the hardware design and measures execution time.
#
# Usage:
#   make         - Compile and run the cocotb batch testbench
#   make clean   - Remove generated simulation files and outputs
#
# Notes:
# - Designed to validate end-to-end batch processing with 2MB messages.
# - Be sure to adjust TOPLEVEL, MODULE, and VERILOG_SOURCES for your wrapper 
#   or top-level module as needed.

# Language and simulator
TOPLEVEL_LANG = verilog
SIM = verilator

# Top-level module name in SystemVerilog
TOPLEVEL = chacha20_core

# Python test module name (without .py)
MODULE = test_chacha20_batch

# Source files
VERILOG_SOURCES = $(shell pwd)/chacha20core.sv

# Include Cocotb makefiles
COCOTB_MAKE := $(shell cocotb-config --makefiles)
include $(COCOTB_MAKE)/Makefile.sim
