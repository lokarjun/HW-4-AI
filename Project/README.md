## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **hardware-accelerated ChaCha20 stream cipher** as part of a chiplet-based architecture. The design focuses on accelerating cryptographic workloads using a SystemVerilog core with a Python-based verification and software interface.

The goal is to compare and evaluate the performance of a pure Python implementation vs. a hardware-accelerated system using:

- **Hardware core:** ChaCha20 encryption engine (SystemVerilog)
- **Wrapper module:** Efficient I/O and FSM-based data movement
- **Cocotb testbench:** Full Python test automation and benchmarking
- **OpenLane:** ASIC synthesis, placement, routing, and physical design
- **Performance profiling:** CPU-only vs. HW-accelerated throughput and latency analysis

> 🧪 Benchmarked up to **2MB input size**, where hardware acceleration provides a **~5× speedup** over optimized Python implementation.

## 🧩 Chiplet Architecture

The ChaCha20 accelerator is designed as a modular chiplet that communicates with the software via an SPI interface. The chiplet reads 64-byte plaintext blocks from software, encrypts them using ChaCha20 core, and returns ciphertext, all under FSM control. The design supports multi-block streaming via the wrapper module.
