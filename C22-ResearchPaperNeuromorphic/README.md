## üß† Blog-style Summary

This repository includes a blog-style post discussing insights from the paper and addressing five core reflection questions relevant to the future of neuromorphic systems. Topics covered include:

### 1. Most Significant Research Challenge
- **Neuronal scalability** was identified as the most critical barrier to achieving brain-scale neuromorphic computing.
- Discussed how overcoming this would unlock real-world deployment at scale.

### 2. Neuromorphic "AlexNet Moment"
- Proposed potential triggers such as hybrid SNN-ANN frameworks and scalable, general-purpose neuromorphic hardware.
- Applications include lifelong learning systems and ultra-low-power adaptive prosthetics.

### 3. Proposal to Bridge Hardware-Software Gap
- Introduced the idea of a **Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation (NIR)** similar to ONNX.
- Advocated for unified toolchains and backend-agnostic APIs.

### 4. Novel Benchmarking Metrics
- Suggested unique metrics like:
  - Energy per synaptic operation (ESP)
  - Spike timing precision (STP)
  - Lifelong learning index (LLI)
- Emphasized standardized protocols and benchmark suites.

### 5. Promise of Emerging Memory Technologies
- Discussed how **memristors** and **phase-change memory** enable new architectures for in-memory computation.
- Outlined key directions like device-circuit co-design and stochastic computation.
