# Hardware for AI and ML â€” ECE 410/510

This repository contains my complete weekly challenges and project work for the **Hardware for AI and Machine Learning** course (Spring 2025).

## ðŸ“š **Course Overview**
This course explores how modern hardware architectures support AI and ML workloads. Topics covered include:
- Hardware-software co-design
- GPU programming for AI/ML
- Deep neural networks on GPUs
- Systolic arrays
- In-memory computation (trade-offs and advantages)
- Neuromorphic computing (TrueNorth, Loihi, Akida)
- Benchmarking and performance analysis

- **C4**: Neuron design using LLM
- **C6**: Perceptron learning NAND
- **C7**: Perceptron learning visualisation
- **C8**: Multi-layer feed-forward perceptron (XOR gate)
- **C10**: Computational Bottlenecks in Q-Learning (Frozen Lake)
- **C11**: CPU vs GPU acceleration
- **C13**: CUDA SAXPY
- **C14**: CUDA environment and performance scaling
- **C16**: CUDA vs PyTorch comparison
- **C17**: Systolic array bubble sort
- **C19**: Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron in SystemVerilog
- **C20**: Crossbar Multiplication in SPICE
- **C22**: Research paper on neuromorphic computing
- **C26**: BrainChip Akida IP and TENN architecture
- **C28**: Memristor modeling and simulation in Python

### ðŸ“ˆ **Project**
