# Challenge 26: BrainChip’s IP for Targeting AI Applications at the Edge

## Overview

This repository investigates BrainChip's neuromorphic approach for deploying AI applications at the edge. It focuses on the Akida chip and the Temporal Event-Based Neural Network (TENN) architecture, comparing them to traditional GPU-based inference and other neuromorphic chips including IBM TrueNorth, Intel Loihi, and NorthPole.

## Goals

- Understand BrainChip’s IP model and TENN architecture.
- Evaluate how TENNs enable low-latency, sparse, and efficient inference.
- Compare BrainChip's edge-focused approach with other neural processors.

## Deliverables

- `Challenge26_Writeup.docx`: A comprehensive write-up comparing BrainChip's Akida and TENNs to GPUs and neuromorphic chips (Loihi, TrueNorth, NorthPole).

## Key Insights

- TENNs combine stable training with efficient recurrent inference.
- Akida’s architecture supports sparse, causal, event-driven execution.
- BrainChip outperforms in low-power, streaming edge scenarios compared to traditional platforms.
